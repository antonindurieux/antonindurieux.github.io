# About me

Hi, my name is Antonin. I am a Data Science enthusiast with a prior background in geosciences. I just finished a [Post Master's Degree in Big Data at Télécom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/fr/masteres-specialises/tous-les-ms/big-data) and I am currently looking for a new professionnal opportunity that would allow me to apply my Data Science skills to transform
data into insights.

My initial education was in geosciences and [geophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics), which allowed me to work for a variety of clients from the oil & gas, mining, geothermal and natural risks industries, all over the world. During these years I was particularly delighted to work on a broad range of data types: seismic, electric, gravimetry, electric, electromagnetic and [magnetotellurics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetotellurics).

I then decided to attend a Post Master's Degree in Big Data. I wanted to have a stronger knowledge on statistical analysis and Machine Learning techniques. I also desired to expend my domain of expertise and be able to process a wider type of data to extract value from it. Moreover, it was a good opportunity to have a deeper knowledge on different mathematical topics, and to reinforce my programming skills.

I completed my Post Master's graduate internship at [Tictactrip](https://www.tictactrip.eu/), a booking platform for direct or multimodal trips in Europe. There I handled all the data-related topics of the start-up during my stay, be it by developing transport companies data integration APIs, analysing data to build a price data cache, or building data-visualization dashboards.

You can find my resume [here](assets/files/Antonin_Durieux_resume.pdf), as well as some examples of the kind of work I love to do [here](/portfolio/). Also feel free to [reach out to me](mailto:antonin.durieux@gmail.com) on any topic or questions you could have!
