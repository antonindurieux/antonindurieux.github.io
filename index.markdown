# About me

Hi, my name is Antonin. I am a Data Scientist enthusiast with a prior background in geosciences. I just finished a [Post Master's Degree in Big Data at Télécom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/fr/masteres-specialises/tous-les-ms/big-data) and I am currently looking for a new professionnal opportunity that would allow me to apply all my skills to transform
data into insights in an industrial context.

My initial education was in geosciences. I started my career as a [geophysicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics), first at [Géolithe](https://www.geolithe.fr/), then at [CGG](https://www.cgg.com). These experiences allowed me to work for a variety of clients from the oil & gas, mining, geothermal and natural risks industries. I had the fantastic opportunity to travel the world and work with great people from various culture, whether it be in Asia, Africa, Oceania or closer to home in Europe. My work consisted in supervising geophysical data acquisition campaign, as well as analyzing and processing data which was my favorite part of the job! I was delighted to work on a broad range of physical sensor data types: seismic, electric, gravimetry, electric, electromagnetic and [magnetotellurics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetotellurics).

I then decided to attend a Post Master's Degree in Big Data. I wanted to have a stronger knowledge on statistical analysis and Machine Learning techniques. I also desired to expend my domain of expertise and be able to process a wider type of data to extract value from it. Moreover, it was a good opportunity to have a deeper knowledge on different mathematical topics, and to reinforce my programming skills.

I completed my Post Master's graduate internship at [Tictactrip](https://www.tictactrip.eu/), a booking platform for direct or multimodal trips in Europe. There I handled all the data-related topics of the start-up during my stay, be it by developing transport companies data integration APIs, analysing data to build a price data cache, or building data-visualization dashboards.

You can find my resume [here](assets/files/Antonin_Durieux_resume.pdf), as well as some examples of my work [here](/portfolio/). Also feel free to [reach out to me](mailto:antonin.durieux@gmail.com) on any topic or questions you could have!
